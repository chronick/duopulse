Here’s a practical “swing cheat sheet” you can actually use on a drum machine / DAW, with a focus on 16th-note swing.

I’ll assume:
	•	50% = straight
	•	Higher % = more late off-beats (more lurchy / shuffly)
	•	Swing mostly applied to hats, percs, ghosts, not usually the main kick on 1 & 3 / 1,5,9,13.

Quick starting points by genre

Techno

Goal: Subtle forward motion, not obviously “jazzy.”
	•	Typical tempo: 125–135 BPM
	•	Grid: 16th-note swing
	•	Good starting ranges:
	•	Straight/minimal: 52–54%
	•	Groovy but still “techno”: 54–57%
	•	Too much for most techno: >59% usually starts to feel housey or wonky

Tips:
	•	Keep kicks and main claps straight, swing only:
	•	Closed hats
	•	Shakers
	•	Ghost percussion
	•	Try:
	•	Hats @ 55%
	•	Perc loops @ 56–58%
	•	Kicks → no swing

⸻

Tribal / Percussive Techno

Goal: More human, circular groove, lots of drums talking to each other.
	•	Typical tempo: 120–130 BPM
	•	Grid: 16ths, occasionally 8ths for slower stuff
	•	Good starting ranges:
	•	Mild tribal feel: 56–58%
	•	Pronounced shuffle: 58–62%
	•	Extreme / broken tribal: 62–65% (use sparingly)

Tips:
	•	Let the main 4/4 kick stay straight, but:
	•	Swing congas, toms, bongos, shakers, rimshots
	•	Nice pattern:
	•	Hats & shakers: 58–60%
	•	Congas/toms: 60–62%
	•	Claps/snares: either straight or lightly swung (56–58%)
	•	If it starts to feel like it’s dragging, dial the swing back 1–2% or raise tempo 1–2 BPM.

⸻

Trip Hop

Goal: Lazy, behind-the-beat, almost drunk groove.

Here it’s more about feeling late than bouncy club shuffle.
	•	Typical tempo: 70–95 BPM (often 80–90 with halftime backbeat)
	•	Grid: Often feels like 8th-note swing because of slower tempo, but you can still use 16ths.
	•	Good starting ranges:
	•	Subtle lazy feel: 56–60%
	•	Classic trip hop wobble: 60–64%
	•	Super drunk: 64–68% (pair with velocity / timing randomness)

Tips:
	•	Often:
	•	Kicks straight or barely swung (52–54%)
	•	Snares slightly behind grid (manual nudge, not just global swing)
	•	Hats/percs with heavier swing (60–64%)
	•	Try:
	•	Turn on swing to 62% for hats/shakers
	•	Manually push snares 10–20 ms late instead of relying only on swing
	•	Add a bit of timing randomization (±3–6 ms) for extra looseness.

⸻

Glitch / IDM-ish Stuff

Goal: Controlled broken timing, feels intentional/algorithmic rather than jam-band.
	•	Tempo: 90–150+ BPM (wide range)
	•	Grid: 16ths, 32nds, plus manual nudge/microtiming
	•	Good swing base ranges:
	•	Mild “off” feel: 54–58%
	•	Noticeably skewed: 58–65%
	•	Extreme base swing: 65–75% (but usually only on some tracks)

Tips:
	•	Use swing as a starting grid bias, then:
	•	Micro-nudge individual steps earlier or later per track.
	•	Combine positive and negative nudges so it doesn’t all just “drag.”
	•	One nice approach:
	•	Global swing: 56–60%
	•	Hats track: some steps nudged ahead (-5 to -15 ms), some behind (+5 to +20 ms)
	•	Glitch percs: occasionally swing 70%+ on short bursts or fills only.
	•	For IDM / glitchy drums, you can also:
	•	Keep kick + main snare straight
	•	Go wild with swing/microtiming on ghost hits, rolls, stutters.

How this maps to common gear

Even if you’re not on these exact boxes, the mental model is useful.

Elektron (Rytm, Digitakt, etc.)
	•	Global swing applied per pattern:
	•	Techno: 54–57
	•	Tribal: 57–60
	•	Trip hop: 60–64
	•	Glitch: 56-ish global, then use per-step microtiming for chaos
	•	Usually:
	•	Disable swing on BD / main SD
	•	Enable swing on HH / perc tracks
	•	Use TRIG → Micro Timing to push specific hits ahead/behind.

Ableton / DAW
	•	Start with 16th swing grooves:
	•	Techno: Swing ~55–57%, or try MPC-style grooves with low intensity.
	•	Trip hop: 16A/B at 60–65%, velocity humanization + timing randomization.
	•	Apply groove to:
	•	HH & perc MIDI clips
	•	Maybe parallel layers differently (e.g. hats more swing, percs less).

Simple “recipe” presets

If you just want numbers to punch in:
	1.	Straightish Techno
	•	Global swing: 55%
	•	Swing on: hats + shakers
	•	Kicks/claps: no swing
	2.	Rolling Tribal
	•	Global swing: 59%
	•	Swing on: all percs (conga/toms/rims) + hats
	•	Kick: straight
	3.	Classic Trip Hop
	•	Global swing: 62%
	•	Swing on: hats + ghost snares
	•	Manually nudge main snare slightly late
	•	Add ±5–10 ms random timing
	4.	Glitchy Base Grid
	•	Global swing: 57%
	•	Swing on: most percs
	•	Then per-step: some hits advanced, some delayed by up to ~20 ms

If you tell me what box/DAW you’re primarily using (Rytm, Digitakt, Octatrack, Ableton, etc.), I can translate these into very concrete “set this knob here, disable swing on these tracks, nudge these steps like this” recipes for that specific setup.
