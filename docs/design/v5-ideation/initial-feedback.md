# Duopulse V5

Duopulse v4 was a big improvement, some thoughts:

Controls are unwieldly. Config mode + shift for both modes increases complexity.
We should strive to include just one set of 4 performance controls + 4 config mode controls.

Performance: 

1 For energy
1 morphs between 'regular' vs 'irregular' (morphs between euclidian vs musically-random-ish with hit budgets, maybe we can improve both algorithms?)
2 for navigation within current algorithm paradigm (euclidian navigation vs X/Y seeking) but if this proves too complex lets refine.

Config:
Not sure exactly what is best for config mode. I only want length so we can move between a 1-bar "techno" style structure and a more song-oriented structure. Works with existing build/phrase arc potentially.

Aux mode good for config since I want alternate aux modes


Aux modes:
Can be simplified to just hat + fill bar for now

Button:
- Freeing up button lets us do things like manual fills, or some kind of performance toggle. What are our options?

Voice coupling doesn't feel important.


The important thing is we can maintain simplicity with fewer controls, challenge is maintaining expressiveness with these new limitations.

Lets also not limit ourselves to specific genres of music and act on first-principles.
