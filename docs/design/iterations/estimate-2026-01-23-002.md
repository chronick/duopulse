## Improvement Estimates

**Goal**: Improve syncopation in syncopated zone from 0.54 to 0.70+
**Target Metric**: syncopated zone syncopation

### Predicted Changes

**Levers to adjust**:
- minRotation (syncopated zone): 2 -> 3 (+50%)
- maxRotation (syncopated zone): 4 -> 5 (+25%)
- Rationale: Pattern rotation is the ONLY proven mechanism for improving syncopation (per iterations 004 and 001). Each additional rotation step shifts hits further off strong beats.

### Predicted Impact

**Primary Effects** (target metric):
- syncopation syncopated: Expected +20-35% improvement (0.54 -> 0.65-0.73)
- Reasoning: Iteration 001 showed +26.4% gain from (min=1,max=3) -> (min=2,max=4). Applying same delta should yield similar gains, though with diminishing returns.
- Confidence: HIGH (75%)

**Secondary Effects** (other metrics):
- regularity syncopated: Expected -5% to +5% (neutral to slight improvement)
  - Previous iteration showed unexpected +2.3% improvement, so direction uncertain
- voiceSeparation syncopated: Expected +0% to +5%
  - Previous iteration showed +5.7% improvement from anchor shifting away from shimmer
- Pentagon Score: Expected -2% to +2% (neutral)

**Risk Assessment**:
- Regression risk: LOW
- Potential regressions: None predicted. Previous iteration showed all secondaries improved.
- Mitigation: Monitor regularity stays within 0.42-0.68 target range

### Success Criteria

- Target metric (syncopation syncopated) improves by >= 10%
- Syncopation syncopated reaches >= 0.60 (ideally >= 0.70)
- No metric regresses by > 3%
- All tests pass

### Learning Objectives

What will this iteration teach us about:
- Diminishing returns on rotation increases
- Whether min=3, max=5 overshoots the sweet spot
- How close we can get to the 0.70 target with rotation alone
