# Estimate: 2026-01-20-007 - Investigate Voice Separation in Wild Zone

**Note**: This estimate was pivoted to an INVESTIGATION based on design-critic feedback.
See `2026-01-20-007.md` for full investigation results.

## Original Goal

Reduce voice separation in wild zone from 0.92 to within target range (0.32-0.68).

## Pivot Decision

Design-critic identified this as a potential design alignment issue (like syncopation in 006).
Investigation revealed the target range is misaligned with COMPLEMENT spec design.

## Target Metric

- **Metric**: voiceSeparation
- **Zone**: wild (SHAPE 0.7-1.0)
- **Current**: 0.92
- **Target Max**: 0.68
- **Gap**: +0.24 (35% over target max)
- **Direction**: REDUCE (need lower voice separation)

## Lever Analysis

### Parameter Domain Check

Wild zone is defined by SHAPE parameter (0.7-1.0). We need levers that affect behavior at high SHAPE values.

Voice separation is affected by how MUCH overlap exists between anchor and shimmer hits. More overlap = lower separation.

**Potential levers:**
1. **kRandomFadeStart** (-): Earlier random influence could create more chaotic patterns with less structure
2. **kEuclideanFadeEnd** (-): Euclidean ending earlier means less structured patterns, potentially more overlap

However, from sensitivity matrix:
- voiceSeparation sensitivity to all SHAPE levers is very low (~0.01)
- No primary or secondary levers identified for voiceSeparation

**Bootstrap Heuristic** (from algorithm_config.h):
- kVoiceSeparationPrimary: "drift" (runtime param, not config)
- kVoiceSeparationSecondary: "kAnchorKMax" (-) - sparser anchor creates MORE gaps, not less

**Problem**: To REDUCE voice separation, we need MORE overlap between anchor/shimmer.

**Proposed approach:**
- **Increase kShimmerKMax** from 16 to 18 (higher shimmer density at high ENERGY = more chance of overlap)
- At wild zone (high SHAPE), patterns are less structured, so shimmer may overlap more with anchor

Wait - wild zone is SHAPE-based, not ENERGY-based. Let me reconsider.

Voice separation at high SHAPE could be reduced by:
1. Making shimmer patterns more similar to anchor patterns at high SHAPE
2. Reducing the "complementary" nature of the generation

Actually, looking at this more carefully - the issue may be that voice separation calculation considers ALL shimmer/anchor combinations, and at high SHAPE the patterns are still quite distinct.

**Alternative hypothesis**: At high SHAPE (wild), the random algorithm dominates. Random patterns for anchor and shimmer are independent, so they naturally have low overlap. This creates HIGH voice separation.

To reduce wild zone voice separation, we could:
- Make random patterns less random (but that defeats "wild" zone purpose)
- OR accept that wild zone naturally has high separation due to chaotic patterns

**Reality check**: This might be a DESIGN alignment issue similar to syncopation - wild patterns are DESIGNED to be chaotic/unpredictable, which naturally creates voice separation.

Let me check if there's a simpler lever change that could help.

## Proposed Changes

**Lever**: `kRandomFadeStart`
- **Current**: 0.50
- **Proposed**: 0.40 (-20%)
- **Rationale**: Earlier random influence means random patterns kick in sooner. Random patterns affect BOTH anchor and shimmer, potentially creating similar chaos across voices = more overlap = less separation.

**Risk**: This affects syncopated zone too (SHAPE 0.3-0.7), potentially making it more chaotic.

## Predicted Impact

### Primary Effects (target metric)

| Metric | Zone | Predicted Change | Confidence |
|--------|------|------------------|------------|
| voiceSeparation | wild | -8% to -15% | LOW (40%) |

**Reasoning**:
- Sensitivity matrix shows voiceSeparation sensitivity to SHAPE levers is very low (~0.01)
- This is a speculative change based on reasoning about algorithm behavior
- Bootstrap heuristic suggests drift (runtime param) is the primary lever, not config params

### Secondary Effects (other metrics)

| Metric | Zone | Predicted Change | Reasoning |
|--------|------|------------------|-----------|
| syncopation | syncopated | +2% to +5% | Earlier random may add unpredictability |
| regularity | syncopated | -3% to -8% | More random = less regular |
| regularity | stable | No change | Random doesn't affect low SHAPE |

### Risk Assessment

- **Regression risk**: MEDIUM
- **Potential regressions**:
  - Syncopated zone regularity may decrease (already in good range 0.52 vs 0.42-0.68)
  - Wild zone regularity may decrease (already borderline 0.54 vs 0.12-0.48 target - actually this would IMPROVE it!)
- **Mitigation**: Small change (20%), will revert if regressions exceed tolerance

## Success Criteria

- Voice separation in wild zone decreases by >= 5% (from 0.92 to <= 0.874)
- No metric regresses by > 2% outside their target range
- All tests pass

## Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Increase kShimmerKMax**: More shimmer hits could increase overlap, but this is ENERGY-based, not SHAPE-based
2. **Accept as design**: Wild zone may naturally have high separation due to chaotic nature
3. **Modify random algorithm**: Out of scope for lever change

## Confidence Assessment

**Overall Confidence: LOW (40%)**

Reasons for low confidence:
- Sensitivity matrix shows no strong levers for voiceSeparation
- This is algorithm-reasoning-based speculation, not data-driven
- Voice separation may be inherently high at wild zone by design

**What we'll learn:**
- Whether random influence timing affects voice separation
- Whether wild zone voice separation is a fundamental algorithm characteristic
- If this fails, we'll need to investigate the voice separation calculation itself

## Pre-flight Checklist

- [x] Lever parameter domain check: kRandomFadeStart affects SHAPE blending
- [x] Similar goal hasn't failed recently: No prior attempts at voice separation
- [x] Bootstrap confidence acknowledged as LOW
- [x] Prediction magnitude scaled by sensitivity (very weak signal expected)
- [x] Causal chain: kRandomFadeStart -> earlier random algorithm -> random affects both voices -> potentially more overlap
