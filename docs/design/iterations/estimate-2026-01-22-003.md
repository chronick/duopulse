## Improvement Estimates

**Goal**: Unblock syncopation - improve syncopated zone syncopation metric
**Target Metric**: syncopation (syncopated zone)

### Initial Hypothesis (INCORRECT)

Initially attempted to change algorithm_config.h:
- kEuclideanFadeStart: 0.30f -> 0.20f (-33%)
- kSyncopationCenter: 0.50f -> 0.40f (-20%)

**Discovery**: These config values only affect debug output visualization, NOT the actual pattern generation! The real generation uses PatternField zone system.

### Revised Hypothesis: PatternField Zone Alignment

**Levers adjusted**:
- PatternField.h zone boundaries shifted to align with eval SHAPE zones
- kShapeZone1End: 0.28f -> 0.26f (stable zone ends earlier)
- kShapeCrossfade1End: 0.32f -> 0.30f (crossfade ends exactly at syncopated zone start)
- kShapeZone2bEnd: 0.68f -> 0.66f (upper syncopation ends earlier)
- kShapeCrossfade3End: 0.72f -> 0.70f (crossfade ends exactly at wild zone start)

### Expected Impact

With zone boundaries aligned:
- At SHAPE=0.30, PatternField enters Zone 2a (pure syncopation)
- GenerateSyncopationPattern should produce syncopation-dominant weights
- Gumbel selection should pick more weak-beat positions

**Confidence**: LOW (40%) - Zone alignment alone may not be sufficient

### Predicted Impact (Revised)

**Primary Effects**:
- syncopated zone syncopation: Expected +10-20% improvement
- Reasoning: Zone alignment ensures syncopation weights are used at SHAPE=0.30

**Risk Assessment**:
- Regression risk: LOW (only changed boundaries, not algorithm behavior)
- Main risk: Change may have minimal effect on syncopation metric

### Learning Objectives

1. Does zone boundary alignment affect syncopation metric?
2. Is the syncopation weight field itself the bottleneck?
3. What determines hit position selection in Gumbel sampling?
