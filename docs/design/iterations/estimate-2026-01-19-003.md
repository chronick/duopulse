## Improvement Estimates

**Iteration ID**: 2026-01-19-003
**Goal**: Improve regularity in stable zone (0.56 → 0.72+)
**Target Metric**: regularity (stable zone)

### Previous Attempt Analysis

Iteration 2026-01-19-002 attempted the same goal using `kEuclideanFadeEnd` (SHAPE lever) and failed with 14% prediction accuracy. The critical error was **ENERGY vs SHAPE domain confusion** - SHAPE levers don't affect ENERGY-defined zones.

**This iteration's difference**: Using an ENERGY-domain lever (`kAnchorKMin`) that directly affects anchor voice at low ENERGY - the bootstrap-recommended lever for stable zone with **5/5 confidence**.

### Critic Feedback Integration

Design-critic agent reviewed initial proposal (kAuxKMin) and identified:
1. kAuxKMin affects aux voice, not anchor regularity (unclear mechanism)
2. Bootstrap heuristics recommend kAnchorKMin with 5/5 confidence
3. N=2 stable patterns is statistically weak but acceptable for learning iteration

**Pivot**: Changed from kAuxKMin to kAnchorKMin based on critic feedback.

### Predicted Changes

**Levers to adjust**:
- `kAnchorKMin`: 4 → 3 (-25%)
- Rationale: At low ENERGY (stable zone), anchor patterns use k closer to kAnchorKMin. euclidean(16, 3) produces more sparse, focused foundation patterns. Sparser anchor = cleaner foundation = potentially higher regularity.

### Predicted Impact

**Primary Effects** (target metric):
- **stable zone regularity**: Expected +3-8% improvement (0.56 → 0.58-0.60)
- Reasoning: Sparser anchor patterns create cleaner rhythmic foundation, reducing complexity
- Confidence: **MEDIUM-LOW** (40%)

**Why MEDIUM-LOW confidence**:
1. Bootstrap heuristic has 5/5 confidence, but no sensitivity data to validate
2. Small sample size (only 2 stable zone patterns in test suite)
3. Euclidean patterns are inherently regular regardless of k, so effect may be small
4. First time testing ENERGY-domain lever empirically

**Secondary Effects** (other metrics):
- **stable zone density**: Expected -5-10% (fewer anchor hits)
  - This is BENEFICIAL: current 0.59 is above target 0.15-0.32
- **stable zone syncopation**: Expected 0% (already at 0, euclidean is non-syncopated)
- **syncopated zone regularity**: Expected +1-2% (minor spillover at zone boundary)
- **syncopated zone density**: Expected -2-4% (kAnchorKMin still influences mid-ENERGY)
- **wild zone metrics**: Expected 0% (kAnchorKMax unchanged at 12, dominates at high ENERGY)

Reasoning: kAnchorKMin primarily affects ENERGY≈0 patterns. Effect diminishes linearly as ENERGY increases toward 1.0.

**Risk Assessment**:
- Regression risk: **LOW**
- Potential regressions:
  - Voice separation might decrease if anchor becomes too sparse (less interlock with shimmer)
  - Density regression in syncopated zone (minor, likely acceptable)
- Mitigation:
  - Change is conservative (-25%, only 1 hit difference)
  - Density dropping is beneficial in stable zone
  - voiceSeparation is currently high (0.89-0.95), has headroom

### Success Criteria

- Target metric (stable zone regularity) improves by >= 3%
- No metric regresses by > 2% (except density in stable zone, which can decrease toward target)
- All tests pass

### Learning Objectives

What will this iteration teach us about:
1. Do ENERGY-domain levers (kAnchorKMin) actually affect zone-specific metrics?
2. Is anchor hit density the primary driver of regularity?
3. Is the 2-pattern stable zone sample size sufficient for meaningful measurement?
4. Should we update the sensitivity matrix to include ENERGY-domain levers?
5. Does the bootstrap heuristic's 5/5 confidence hold empirically?

### Backup Plan

If this approach fails (kAnchorKMin doesn't improve regularity):
- Investigate if SHAPE parameter varies in the "stable zone" test patterns
- Consider if regularity metric needs recalibration (euclidean should be 1.0 regular)
- Expand test suite before next iteration

### Pre-Flight Checklist

- [x] Verified lever parameter domain matches target zone domain (ENERGY lever for ENERGY zone)
- [x] Checked similar goal failed with different approach (SHAPE lever)
- [x] Applied MEDIUM-LOW confidence (critic-adjusted from initial estimate)
- [x] Incorporated design-critic feedback (pivot from kAuxKMin to kAnchorKMin)
- [x] Documented learning objectives for calibrating future iterations
