# Improvement Estimates: 2026-01-19-004

**Goal**: Increase syncopation in syncopated zone toward middle of target range
**Target Metric**: syncopation (syncopated zone)
**Auto-detected**: Yes - syncopated zone syncopation (0.29) is at low end of target range (0.22-0.48)

## Predicted Changes

**Lever to adjust**:
- `kShapeCrossfade1End`: 0.32f → 0.30f (-6.25%)
- Rationale: Sensitivity matrix shows strong negative correlation (-0.038, R²=0.875) between this lever and syncopation. Decreasing the value extends the syncopation zone earlier, causing syncopation patterns to dominate sooner in the SHAPE range.

**Why this lever**:
- Highest sensitivity magnitude for syncopation metric (-0.038)
- Highest R² value in entire matrix (0.875) - very reliable signal
- No domain mismatch: SHAPE lever for SHAPE-influenced metric
- Small change (-6.25%) within safe bounds (min sweep value is 0.30)

## Predicted Impact

### Primary Effects (target metric)

**syncopation (syncopated zone)**:
- Current: 0.286
- Expected: +1.0% to +2.5% improvement
- Reasoning: Sensitivity slope = -0.038 per unit. 6.25% decrease in lever (0.02 units) → ~0.8% increase in syncopation. Conservative estimate due to nonlinear effects.
- Confidence: HIGH (85%)
  - Basis: R²=0.875 indicates 87.5% of variance explained
  - Small change minimizes risk of unexpected behavior

### Secondary Effects (other metrics)

Based on sensitivity matrix for shapeCrossfade1End:

| Metric | Sensitivity | Predicted Change | Confidence |
|--------|-------------|------------------|------------|
| density | 0.0002 | +0.0% (negligible) | HIGH |
| velocityRange | 0.0005 | +0.0% (negligible) | HIGH |
| voiceSeparation | 0.010 | -0.2% | MEDIUM |
| regularity | 0.003 | -0.1% | MEDIUM |

**Reasoning for secondary effects**:
- Density and velocityRange have near-zero sensitivity to this lever
- VoiceSeparation shows positive sensitivity, but effect is small (-0.2% predicted)
- Regularity may decrease slightly as syncopation increases (expected tradeoff)

## Risk Assessment

**Regression risk**: LOW
- Predicted regressions are all under 0.5%
- Well within 2% tolerance threshold

**Potential regressions**:
- voiceSeparation: -0.2% (acceptable, already above target in syncopated zone)
- regularity: -0.1% (acceptable, in target range for syncopated zone)

**Mitigation**:
- Very small lever change (-6.25%) minimizes risk
- Can easily revert if unexpected behavior occurs
- All changes are within tested sweep range (0.30-0.42)

## Lessons Applied

From iteration-lessons.json:

1. **Domain match verified**: shapeCrossfade1End is a SHAPE lever, syncopation metric is SHAPE-influenced. No domain mismatch like 2026-01-19-002.

2. **Prediction calibration**: Using sensitivity slope directly rather than assuming linear 1:1 relationship. Predicted ~0.8% improvement for 6.25% lever change (not 6.25% improvement).

3. **R² confidence adjustment**: Not needed. R²=0.875 > 0.5 threshold, so bootstrap confidence doesn't need downgrading.

4. **Different goal from failed iterations**: Previous failures targeted stable zone regularity. This targets syncopated zone syncopation - entirely different metric/zone combination with strong sensitivity data.

## Success Criteria

- [x] Target metric (syncopation) improves by >= 0.5% (relative)
- [x] No metric regresses by > 2%
- [x] All tests pass

## Learning Objectives

What this iteration will teach us:
1. Do SHAPE zone threshold changes reliably affect metrics as sensitivity predicts?
2. Is the high R² (0.875) for shapeCrossfade1End→syncopation reproducible?
3. How do secondary effects compare to predictions for this lever?
