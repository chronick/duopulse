## Improvement Estimates

**Goal**: Improve syncopated zone syncopation to reach 0.70 target
**Target Metric**: syncopation (syncopated zone)

### Predicted Changes

**Levers to adjust**:
- minRotation (syncopated zone): 1 -> 2 (+100%)
- maxRotation (syncopated zone): 3 -> 4 (+33%)
- Rationale: Iteration 004 proved rotation is the mechanism for syncopation. Larger guaranteed rotation = more displacement = higher syncopation metric.

### Predicted Impact

**Primary Effects** (target metric):
- syncopation (syncopated zone): Expected +9% improvement (0.64 -> 0.70)
- Reasoning: Rotation shifts hits off strong metric positions. A 2-step minimum rotation guarantees displacement to at least step 2 (weak 16th), creating consistent tension.
- Confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH (75%)

**Secondary Effects** (other metrics):
- regularity (syncopated): Expected -3% to -5% change (0.62 -> 0.59-0.60)
- voiceSeparation (syncopated): Expected minimal change (<1%)
- Reasoning: Larger rotation disrupts gap uniformity slightly, but effect is bounded because rotation preserves relative spacing.

**Risk Assessment**:
- Regression risk: LOW
- Potential regressions: regularity may drop 3-5%, but target range is 0.42-0.68 (current 0.62 has buffer)
- Mitigation: If regularity drops below 0.55, consider reducing maxRotation back to 3

### Success Criteria

- Target metric (syncopation syncopated) improves to >= 0.70 (currently 0.64)
- No metric regresses by > 5%
- regularity stays within target range (0.42-0.68)
- All tests pass

### Learning Objectives

What will this iteration teach us about:
- How sensitive syncopation is to minimum rotation value
- Whether there's a rotation "sweet spot" beyond which returns diminish
- The tradeoff ratio between rotation and regularity
