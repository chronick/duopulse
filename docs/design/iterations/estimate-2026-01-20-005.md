## Improvement Estimates

**Goal**: Fix Minimal Techno and Four on Floor preset conformance
**Target**: Preset conformance scores from 65-67% to 80%+
**Iteration ID**: 2026-01-20-005

### Predicted Changes

**Files to modify**: `tools/evals/generate-patterns.js`

**Levers to adjust**:
1. Minimal Techno ENERGY: 0.25 -> 0.10 (-60%)
   - Rationale: ENERGY=0.25 produces 12 V1 hits (40.6% density)
   - Target density max 0.30 = 19 hits max, but reference is [0,16,32,48] = 4 hits = 6.25%
   - ENERGY=0.10 (MINIMAL zone) produces ~4 anchor hits, matching reference

2. Four on Floor ENERGY: 0.5 -> 0.15 (-70%)
   - Rationale: ENERGY=0.5 produces density 0.50, target is 0.25 +/- 0.15
   - Reference pattern is 16 hits (25% density)
   - ENERGY=0.15 should produce ~16 V1 hits at low SHAPE

### Predicted Impact

**Primary Effects** (target metrics):
- Minimal Techno score: 65% -> 85-95% (expected +30-50%)
- Four on Floor score: 67% -> 80-90% (expected +20-35%)
- Confidence: HIGH (90%)

**Secondary Effects** (other metrics):
- Presets passing: 6/8 -> 8/8
- Conformance score: 84.6% -> 90%+
- Pentagon metrics: Unchanged (sweep patterns not affected)
- Overall Alignment: +3-5%

**Reasoning**:
Same pattern as iteration 2026-01-20-004 (Driving Techno):
- ENERGY parameter fundamentally mismatched with preset expectations
- Lowering ENERGY reduces hit count, improving density conformance
- Pattern match may still be imperfect, but metric conformance carries score

### Risk Assessment

**Regression risk**: LOW
- Only modifying preset-specific parameters, not sweep patterns
- Pentagon metrics (from sweeps) unaffected
- Other presets unchanged

**Potential issues**:
- Pattern positions may not exactly match references
- Regularity may not hit 0.75 min for Minimal Techno (but should be close)

### Success Criteria

- Minimal Techno score >= 0.75 (passing strict tolerance)
- Four on Floor score >= 0.75 (passing strict tolerance)
- No regression in other preset scores
- All tests pass

### Learning Objectives

What will this iteration teach us about:
- Validating the ENERGY -> density relationship at MINIMAL zone
- Whether MINIMAL zone (ENERGY < 0.20) produces expected sparse patterns
- Confirming preset tuning as key driver for conformance scores
