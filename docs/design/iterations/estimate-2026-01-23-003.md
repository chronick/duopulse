## Improvement Estimates

**Goal**: Improve syncopation in syncopated zone via further rotation increase (min=4, max=6)
**Target Metric**: syncopated zone syncopation

### Predicted Changes

**Levers to adjust**:
- `minRotation` (syncopated zone): 3 -> 4 (+33%)
- `maxRotation` (syncopated zone): 5 -> 6 (+20%)
- Rationale: Continuing the successful pattern from iterations 001 and 002

### Predicted Impact

**Primary Effects** (target metric):
- syncopation (syncopated zone): Expected +15-30% improvement (0.43 baseline -> 0.50-0.56)
- Reasoning: Each additional step of guaranteed minimum rotation displaces hits further from strong metric positions. Iteration 001 achieved +26.4%, iteration 002 achieved +39.3%. Expecting slightly diminishing returns at higher rotation values.
- Confidence: MEDIUM (60%)

**Secondary Effects** (other metrics):
- regularity (syncopated zone): Expected -5% to +5% change (neutral)
  - Previous iterations showed unexpected regularity improvement with rotation increases
- voiceSeparation (syncopated zone): Expected +0% to +5% change
  - Rotation shifts anchor further from shimmer positions
- Reasoning: Higher rotation is more disruptive but previous iterations showed surprising resilience

**Risk Assessment**:
- Regression risk: MEDIUM
- Potential regressions:
  - regularity could drop below 0.42 minimum target (currently at 0.655)
  - Patterns may sound overly displaced (musical judgment needed)
  - Pentagon score might drop due to zone boundary effects
- Mitigation:
  - Regularity has buffer (0.655 vs 0.42 minimum = 0.235 headroom)
  - If patterns sound too chaotic, this is a natural ceiling for rotation approach

### Success Criteria

- Target metric (syncopation syncopated zone) improves by >= 10%
- No metric regresses by > 3%
- All tests pass

### Learning Objectives

What will this iteration teach us about:
- Whether syncopated zone can reach 0.70+ syncopation via rotation alone
- The point of diminishing returns for rotation approach
- Whether min=4 rotation creates musically acceptable patterns or sounds too chaotic
