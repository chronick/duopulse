## Improvement Estimates

**Goal**: Decrease syncopation (currently over-target in all zones)
**Target Metric**: syncopation (reduce from ~0.93 toward targets)

### Context

Current syncopation metrics:
- stable: 1.00 (target: 0.00-0.22) - OVER by 0.78
- syncopated: 0.95 (target: 0.22-0.48) - OVER by 0.47
- wild: 0.77 (target: 0.42-0.75) - OVER by 0.02

Conformance scores for stable-zone presets are failing:
- "Four on Floor": 0.028 (POOR)
- "Minimal Techno": 0.33 (POOR)
- "Driving Techno": 0.08 (POOR)

### Predicted Changes

**Levers to adjust**:
- `kSyncopationWidth`: 0.30f -> 0.20f (-33%)
- Rationale: Narrowing the syncopation bell curve will reduce syncopation contribution across the SHAPE range. This is a global lever that affects all patterns, avoiding the test-point sampling issue from iteration 004.

### Predicted Impact

**Primary Effects** (target metric):
- syncopation (total): Expected -10% to -20% reduction
- Reasoning: Narrower syncopation width means syncopation algorithm contributes less outside its peak SHAPE region. At SHAPE values far from 0.50, patterns will be more euclidean or random-dominated.
- Confidence: MEDIUM (60%)

**Secondary Effects** (other metrics):
- regularity: Expected +5% to +10% improvement
  - Reasoning: Less syncopation = more euclidean influence = more regular patterns
- density: Expected unchanged (syncopation width doesn't affect hit counts directly)
- velocityRange: Expected unchanged (velocity computed separately)
- voiceSeparation: Expected unchanged (voice positions unchanged)

### Risk Assessment

- Regression risk: MEDIUM
- Potential regressions:
  - voiceSeparation could decrease if patterns become more similar (more regular = less diverse)
  - Preset conformance could shift (some presets may prefer more syncopation)
- Mitigation:
  - 33% change is significant but not extreme
  - If regression > 5%, will document as tradeoff and evaluate musical impact

### Success Criteria

- syncopation decreases by >= 5% (toward target ranges)
- No metric regresses by > 5%
- All tests pass
- At least one strict conformance preset improves

### Learning Objectives

What will this iteration teach us about:
- Does kSyncopationWidth affect global syncopation as expected?
- Is bootstrap heuristic for syncopation (kSyncopationWidth direction) correct?
- Does narrowing syncopation bell curve improve stable-zone conformance?

### Pre-Flight Checklist (from lessons)

- [x] Lever operates in correct parameter domain
  - kSyncopationWidth is a SHAPE-blending parameter, affects syncopation algorithm weight
  - Syncopation metric comes from all patterns, not zone-specific
- [x] Similar goal hasn't failed recently with same approach
  - Previous syncopation attempts (004) used zone boundary, not bell curve width
- [ ] Bootstrap confidence adjusted for sensitivity R²
  - No sensitivity data for kSyncopationWidth, using bootstrap only
  - Bootstrap confidence: 3/5 (from algorithm_config.h, secondary lever)
- [ ] Prediction magnitude scaled by sensitivity slope
  - No sensitivity slope available, using mechanism-based prediction

### Notes

This is the first iteration targeting syncopation with bell curve width adjustment.
Previous iteration (004) attempted zone boundary change but affected range was too narrow.
This change should affect ALL patterns by reducing syncopation algorithm weight globally.
