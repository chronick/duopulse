**Goal**: Remove density from SHAPE zone scoring - density is ENERGY-dependent, not SHAPE-dependent

## Improvement Estimates

**Goal**: Fix stable zone density misalignment by removing density from SHAPE zone Pentagon scoring

**Target Metric**: Pentagon composite score, overall alignment

### Context

The stable zone shows density=0.516 vs target 0.15-0.32 (61% over maximum). Investigation revealed:

1. Density is controlled by ENERGY parameter (HitBudget), not SHAPE
2. SHAPE sweeps use fixed ENERGY=0.5, so all SHAPE zones have BUILD-level density (~0.50)
3. The density targets per SHAPE zone assume ENERGY tracks SHAPE - but they're independent

This is a **design misalignment** similar to iterations 006 (syncopation) and 007 (voice separation).

### Change Proposed

**Remove density from SHAPE zone scoring**:
- Remove `density` from the 5-metric Pentagon scoring for SHAPE zones
- Keep density in ENERGY zone evaluation (where it belongs)
- Pentagon becomes 4 metrics: syncopation, velocityRange, voiceSeparation, regularity

### Predicted Impact

**Primary Effects**:
- Pentagon score: Expected +10-15% improvement
  - Removing the 0% density score from stable zone will lift composite
- Overall alignment: Expected +5-10% improvement
  - One fewer failing metric in alignment calculation

**Reasoning**:
- Stable zone composite is 32.6% partly due to density score of 0
- Removing density removes a metric that can never pass for SHAPE sweeps at ENERGY=0.5

**Secondary Effects**:
- Syncopated zone composite: Expected +5-10% (density was also failing there)
- Wild zone composite: Expected +3-5% (density was closer to target there)
- ENERGY zone metrics: No change (density stays in ENERGY evaluation)

**Confidence**: HIGH (95%)
- This is a pure evaluation methodology fix
- No algorithm changes, no lever tuning
- The change makes evaluation more semantically correct

### Risk Assessment

- Regression risk: LOW
- Potential regressions: None expected - we're removing a broken metric
- Pentagon interpretation: Will need documentation that density is ENERGY-dependent

### Success Criteria

- Pentagon score improves
- Overall alignment improves
- No other metrics regress
- Density remains tracked in ENERGY zone evaluation

### Learning Objectives

What will this iteration teach us about:
- Whether separating ENERGY-dependent vs SHAPE-dependent metrics improves evaluation clarity
- Whether 4-metric Pentagon is sufficient for SHAPE zone characterization
