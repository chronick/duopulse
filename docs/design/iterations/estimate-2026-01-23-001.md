## Improvement Estimates

**Goal**: Improve syncopation in syncopated zone
**Target Metric**: syncopated zone syncopation (0.43 → 0.70+ target)
**Iteration ID**: 2026-01-23-001

### Predicted Changes

**Code change (PatternGenerator.cpp lines 198-199)**:
- `minRotation`: 1 → 2 (+100%)
- `maxRotation`: 3 → 4 (+33%)
- Rationale: Guaranteed 2-step minimum rotation (vs current 1-step) creates more displacement from strong beats

**Mechanism**:
1. Rotation physically shifts anchor mask by N steps
2. A 1-step rotation moves beat 1 (step 0) to step 1 (weak 16th)
3. A 2-step rotation moves beat 1 to step 2 (offbeat 8th)
4. Greater displacement = higher syncopation metric

### Predicted Impact

**Primary Effects** (target metric):
- syncopated zone syncopation: Expected +30-50% improvement (0.43 → 0.56-0.65)
- Reasoning: Iteration 004 showed rotation was the only mechanism that improved syncopation (+200% from 0.21→0.64 single-seed). Increasing minimum rotation should further improve multi-seed average.
- Confidence: MEDIUM (65%)

**Why not HIGH confidence**:
- Multi-seed averaging showed 37% stability for syncopation
- Unknown how additional rotation interacts with different seeds
- Iter 004's 0.64 was partially seed artifact (true avg was 0.43)

**Secondary Effects** (other metrics):
- regularity syncopated: Expected -5 to -10% (0.66 → 0.59-0.63)
  - Reasoning: Rotation disrupts uniform gap spacing
  - Target range is 0.42-0.68, so 0.59 would still be acceptable
- voiceSeparation: Expected -2% to +2% (neutral)
  - Reasoning: Rotation doesn't change shimmer placement (only anchor rotates)
- density: Expected 0% change
  - Reasoning: Rotation moves hits, doesn't add/remove them

**Risk Assessment**:
- Regression risk: MEDIUM
- Potential regressions: regularity (expected -5 to -10%)
- Mitigation: regularity target for syncopated zone is wide (0.42-0.68), current 0.66 has room to drop

### Success Criteria

- syncopated zone syncopation improves by >= 15% (0.43 → 0.50+)
- No metric regresses outside target range
- All tests pass

### Learning Objectives

What will this iteration teach us about:
- Whether increased rotation continues to scale syncopation improvement
- The relationship between rotation amount and regularity degradation
- Multi-seed stability of rotation-based syncopation
