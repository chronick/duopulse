## Improvement Estimates

**Goal**: Unblock syncopation - increase weak offbeat weights in GenerateSyncopationPattern
**Target Metric**: syncopated zone syncopation (currently 0.21, target 0.70-1.00)

### Background Context

From iteration 2026-01-22-003:
- Zone alignment confirmed PatternField now enters Zone 2a at SHAPE=0.30
- GenerateSyncopationPattern IS being called at SHAPE=0.30
- BUT syncopation metric still = 0 because weak offbeats can't compete with quarter notes

Current weight distribution in GenerateSyncopationPattern:
- Quarter notes: 0.80 weight (always wins Gumbel selection)
- 8th notes: 0.70 weight
- Anticipation positions: 0.40-0.60 weight (seed-varied)
- Weak offbeats: 0.35-0.55 weight (seed-varied)

At SHAPE=0.50 (crossfade 2a→2b), syncopation=0.83 because TWO different seeds blend, producing different hit positions that include weak beats.

### Predicted Changes

**Code change (PatternField.cpp:58-117)**:
- Weak offbeat weights: 0.35-0.55 → 0.75-0.90 (+115% at center)
- Anticipation weights: 0.40-0.60 → 0.70-0.85 (+55% at center)
- Quarter note weights: 0.80 → 0.60 (-25%)
- 8th note weights: 0.70 → 0.55 (-21%)

Rationale: For syncopation to occur, weak offbeats MUST be able to win Gumbel selection against strong beats. The current weights make this impossible.

### Predicted Impact

**Primary Effects** (target metric):
- syncopated zone syncopation: Expected +40-60% improvement (0.21 → 0.60-0.85)
- SHAPE=0.30 syncopation: Expected improvement from 0 to 0.50-0.80
- Reasoning: Inverting weight hierarchy will cause Gumbel to select weak offbeats over strong beats
- Confidence: MEDIUM (65%)

**Secondary Effects** (other metrics):
- stable zone syncopation: Expected +5-15% (crossfade blending starts at SHAPE=0.26)
- Reasoning: Crossfade 1→2a zone now includes syncopation weights at edges
- Risk: May increase stable zone syncopation above 0.20 target ceiling

- regularity: Expected -5-10% in syncopated zone
- Reasoning: Syncopated patterns have less regular spacing by design

- voiceSeparation: Expected minimal change (<2%)
- Reasoning: Complement relationship unchanged

**Risk Assessment**:
- Regression risk: MEDIUM
- Potential regressions: stable zone syncopation may exceed 0.20 target
- Mitigation: Zone boundary at 0.26 provides buffer before pure syncopation starts

### Success Criteria

- syncopated zone syncopation improves by >= 30% (0.21 → 0.27+)
- SHAPE=0.30 syncopation improves from 0 to > 0.30
- No metric regresses by > 5% (accepting tradeoff if target improves significantly)
- All tests pass

### Learning Objectives

What will this iteration teach us about:
- Whether weight inversion is sufficient to produce syncopation
- How crossfade zones propagate syncopation into stable zone
- Whether the syncopation metric responds linearly to weight changes
