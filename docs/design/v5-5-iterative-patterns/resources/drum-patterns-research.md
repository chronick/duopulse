# Classic Electronic Drum Pattern Research

Research compiled for DuoPulse v5.5 pattern generation algorithm iteration.

## Genre Reference Patterns

### 1. Four on Floor (Techno Kick)

**Signature**: Kick on every quarter note (steps 0, 4, 8, 12 in 16-step)

**Structure**:
- Kick: 1, 2, 3, 4 (every quarter note)
- Hi-hat: Closed on 8ths, open on offbeats ("and" of each beat)
- Snare/Clap: Beats 2 and 4

**Variation sources**:
- Kick velocity dynamics
- Hi-hat open/closed patterns
- Ghost snares on 16th notes

### 2. House Groove

**Signature**: Four-on-floor with offbeat open hi-hat emphasis

**Structure**:
- Kick: Quarter notes (beats 1, 2, 3, 4)
- Hi-hat: Closed 8ths with opens on offbeats (the "and")
- Clap: Beats 2 and 4
- Ride: Often running 8ths or 16ths

**Key elements**:
- Offbeat hi-hat is "the most important ingredient" (from disco influence)
- Sidechain compression makes offbeat hits pop
- Subtle swing/shuffle for groove

**Variation sources**:
- Varying hi-hat lengths (short choked vs. open sustain)
- Ghost notes on snare/clap
- Auxiliary percussion (congas, bongos, shakers)

---

### 3. Tribal Syncopation

**Signature**: Call-and-response patterns with displaced accents

**Structure**:
- Syncopated kick pattern (not strictly 4/4)
- Emphasis on beats 1 and "the 3" with variations
- Polyrhythmic percussion layers

**Key elements**:
- Multiple simultaneous rhythmic layers
- African/Latin influenced patterns
- Cross-rhythms between voices

**Variation sources**:
- Displacement of kicks by 16th notes
- Accent patterns that cycle in 3s over 4/4
- Tom patterns

---

### 4. Breakbeat

**Signature**: Broken rhythms derived from sampled funk breaks

**Classic source**: The Amen Break (7-second drum break from "Amen, Brother" by The Winstons, 1969)

**Structure (Amen Break)**:
- Bar 1: Standard funk pattern with dynamics
- Bar 2: Displaced kick and snare (kick single-hit at bar start, snares held back half-beat)
- Continuous ride pattern

**Key elements**:
- "Double kick hit just before beat 4" - first is quieter than second
- Ghost notes on snare at end of bar
- Displaced snares (pushed back half-beat)

**Variation sources**:
- Chopping and rearranging breaks
- Layering multiple breaks for polyrhythmic effects
- Pitch-shifting individual hits

---

### 5. Industrial Stomp

**Signature**: Heavy, aggressive, mechanical feel

**Structure**:
- Aggressive kick on strong beats
- Layered kick+snare for bigger impact
- High density, minimal space

**Key elements**:
- Snare layered WITH kick for power
- Less hi-hat emphasis
- Distortion/saturation on drums
- "Wall of sound" approach

**Variation sources**:
- Multiple kick layers
- Noise/percussion fills
- Mechanical repetition with micro-variations

---

### 6. Minimal Pulse

**Signature**: Sparse, hypnotic, space-focused

**Structure**:
- Stripped-down kick pattern
- Minimal or no hi-hat
- Focus on groove from minimal elements

**Key elements**:
- "Less is more" philosophy
- Breathing room between hits
- Subtle dynamics and processing

**Variation sources**:
- Subtle velocity changes
- Micro-timing shifts
- Filtering/modulation over time

---

### 7. Dub Techno

**Signature**: Laid-back, processed, ambient feel

**Structure**:
- Soft four-on-floor kick (minimal click/attack)
- Offbeat hat pattern
- Optional minimal clap/snare

**Key elements**:
- "Soft attack with very little click" on kick
- Tape compression character
- Delay-based groove (not swing)
- Filtered, "hiding" quality to elements

**Processing**:
- Cut frequencies then saturate
- Short reverb to blur attacks
- Tape delay feedback

---

### 8. Gabber Assault

**Signature**: Fast, aggressive, distorted kick focus

**Structure**:
- Heavily distorted melodic kick
- 170-190 BPM (heyday range)
- Minimal other elements needed

**Key elements**:
- Kick overdriven into square wave
- Kick develops "melodic tone" from distortion
- Pitch envelope on kick creates sweeping effect
- Often kick follows bassline pitch

**Sound design**:
- Triangle/sine + fast pitch envelope + heavy distortion
- Parallel processing (dry + distorted)
- High-pass filter sweeps for fills

### 9. IDM Complexity

**Signature**: Irregular patterns, algorithmic feel, polyrhythms

**Structure**:
- NOT strictly 4/4 despite often being in 4/4 time
- Intricate grid-shunning drum parts
- Polymeters (different time signatures simultaneously)

**Key elements** (Aphex Twin's "Vordhosbn" kick pattern):
- Uses every 16th subdivision
- Groupings: 3, 8, 3, 3, 5, 5, 7, 3, 9, 2 sixteenths
- Hemiola and syncopation

**Autechre approach**:
- Roland R8 with "crazy sequencer"
- Pitched drum sounds
- Triggers other audio equipment

---

### 10. IDM Chaos

**Signature**: Maximum unpredictability, glitchy, generative

**Techniques**:
- Trackers for fast glitchy drums (Venetian Snares)
- Free-running LFOs (not synced to grid)
- Random/generative sequencing

**Key insight**:
> "Classic '90s IDM is often held up as an example of odd time signatures, but actually, a great deal of it is in plain old 4/4. Producers were just very good at programming MIDI in a way that makes the underlying sequencer grid extremely hard to perceive."

---

### 11. Ambient Scatter

**Signature**: Sparse, random, textural

**Structure**:
- No regular pulse
- Scattered hits across pattern
- Focus on texture over rhythm

**Key elements**:
- High randomness in placement
- Low velocity, subtle hits
- Large gaps between events

---

### 12. Half-Time Feel

**Signature**: Emphasis on beats 1 and 3 (snare on 3 instead of 2&4)

**Structure**:
- Kick: Beat 1 emphasis
- Snare: Beat 3 (instead of 2 and 4)
- Creates "slower" feel at same tempo

**Key elements**:
- Bar feels twice as long
- More space for atmospheric elements
- Common in drum & bass and trap

---

### 13. Polyrhythmic

**Signature**: Multiple conflicting rhythmic layers

**Techniques**:
- 3 over 4 (triplets over quarter notes)
- 5 over 4, 7 over 4
- Layered patterns with different cycle lengths

**Classic trick** (from 303 programming):
- 12-step pattern cycling over 4/4 kick = natural polyrhythm

---

### 14. Acid Drive

**Signature**: Relentless, 303-era inspired

**Structure**:
- Rolling TR-909 drums
- Kick on every quarter note
- Hi-hats running 16ths
- Emphasis on sustained energy

**Key elements**:
- Swing/shuffle important
- Accents drive the pattern
- Works WITH acid bassline (not against it)

---

### 15. Detroit Soul

**Signature**: Funky, machine-groove, swing

**Structure**:
- Four-on-floor base
- Swung hi-hats
- Ghost notes for funk

**Key artist insight** (Jeff Mills):
> "First, I need to know the tempo, so it's always the rimshot since that's the click. From there, it's usually the hi-hat or the kick drum."
> "Once you know the machine really well, you don't need to look at it anymore because you know where all of the placements are by memory."

**Equipment context**:
- Jeff Mills: TR-909 + Yamaha DX100
- Minimalist approach from equipment limitations
- "Playing the machine, not just programming it"

**Reference**: [MusicRadar - Jeff Mills 909 Drums](https://www.musicradar.com/how-to/program-jeff-mills-style-909-drums-1)

---

### 16. Berlin Loop

**Signature**: Hypnotic, repetitive, subtle variation

**Structure**:
- Four-on-floor kick
- Steady hi-hat pattern
- Minimal clap/snare

**Key elements**:
- Repetition as the primary goal
- Very subtle variations bar-to-bar
- Groove from consistency, not change

---

## Cross-Cutting Insights

### Groove Creation Techniques

1. **Swing/Shuffle**: Offsetting certain notes slightly off-grid
2. **Velocity variation**: Ghost notes (low velocity) vs. accents
3. **Timing micro-shifts**: Snare slightly ahead/behind for feel
4. **Hi-hat articulation**: Open/closed interaction, length variation

### Key Differentiators by Genre

| Genre | Kick Pattern | Hi-Hat | Snare/Clap | Density |
|-------|--------------|--------|------------|---------|
| Four on Floor | Every quarter | 8ths | 2 & 4 | Medium |
| House | Every quarter | Offbeat opens | 2 & 4 | Medium |
| Breakbeat | Displaced | Ride | Displaced | Medium |
| Industrial | Strong beats | Minimal | Layered w/kick | High |
| Minimal | Sparse | Optional | Rare | Low |
| Dub Techno | Soft 4/4 | Offbeat | Optional | Low |
| Gabber | Melodic distorted | Minimal | Rare | High |
| IDM | Irregular | Irregular | Irregular | Variable |

### Variation Sources (for algorithm design)

1. **Step displacement**: Moving hits by 16th notes
2. **Velocity dynamics**: Accent/ghost/normal
3. **Swing amount**: 0% to ~70%
4. **Pattern rotation**: Shifting entire pattern
5. **Voice relationship**: Independent vs. complementary
6. **Density modulation**: Sparse to busy transitions
7. **Metric emphasis**: Downbeat vs. offbeat preference
