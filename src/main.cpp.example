/**
 * Example main.cpp - This shows the structure but requires libDaisy for hardware.
 * 
 * NOTE: This project requires both DaisySP (DSP library) and libDaisy (hardware library).
 * The libDaisy library should be added as a submodule or included separately.
 * 
 * For a complete setup, you'll need:
 * - DaisySP (already included as submodule)
 * - libDaisy (hardware abstraction library)
 * 
 * See README.md for full setup instructions.
