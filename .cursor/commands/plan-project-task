    - If no task is provided, list `docs/tasks/` and ask the user which one to plan.
    - If creating a new task, use `docs/tasks/template.md`.
    - Tasks may change the spec if specified.
3.  **Populate Task File**:
    - **Context**: Summarize the relevant spec section.
    - **Requirements**: List specific requirements from the spec.
    - **Implementation Plan**: Create a detailed checklist of coding steps. Use markdown syntax for checklists.
    - **Status**: Set to `active` or `pending`.
